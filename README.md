Hi I'm looking at arduino projects and stm32 based modules with a view to designing a electronic arrow spine tester for archers. 
I am interested in Archery and arrow spine ( the stiffness ) is an important parameter in arrow flight. Current methods are mechanical 
based and suffer many drawbacks and inaccuracies.

I am retired now but was a microchip silicon designer and still enjoy electronic based projects for myself and others.
